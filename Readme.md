This is a sample project that eases the use of the Android Clipboard Framework. 

Magic here happens via the ClipHelper class, please take some time to read through the element comments. 

<b>How does it work? </b>

- Install it on your android device. 
- Use the "Share" option on most apps to simply copy the a link, or text, to the clipboard. 
- Profit?

<b>Why?</b>

- Sometimes you read a nice tweet you want to share with a friend, but rather than retweeting for the whole world, you just want to show this person the text via IM. Normally, you'd have to hit Share on the Twitter app, and then select any app, copy the text from X app, and then go to your IM client and paste...now WHOA! those were too many steps huh?. Well, with Light Clipper you simply "Share" through light clipper and the text is added to the clipboard for you. 
- Share Webpages via "Share Page" on most browsers, Tweets, Statuses, eBay listings from eBay mobile app, market links, and save yourselves those precious 3-5 seconds per paste.

<b>Credits</b>

The project idea is inspired from AOKP's Add to clipboard function that has been provided since early ICS. Please note that although I am using the idea, I never actually glanced at the code in AOKP's repo. This was more of a challenge to get me to write the majority of the code on my own.
